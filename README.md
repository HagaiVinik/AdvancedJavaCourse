# Advanced Java course

## Description: 

This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects designed to explore the fascinating world of Java programming, focusing on advanced features such as multi-threading, JavaFX, synchronization, and more. These projects were implemented by me while I was taking my univetsity's Java course.

### Projects Overview:

* Multi-threading - learn how to create and manage multiple threads concurrently. Explore thread synchronization, race conditions, and how to handle shared resources efficiently.

* JavaFX - a powerful framework for building interactive and visually stunning user interfaces. Craft dynamic applications, work with layouts, and incorporate media elements for an immersive user experience.

* Synchronization in multi-threaded environments - Implementing synchronization techniques like locks, semaphores, and monitors to ensure thread safety and avoid data corruption.
